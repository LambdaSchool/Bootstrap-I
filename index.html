              <H2 class="text-center font-weight-bold">Regular resumes are boring.</H2> I'm not a fan of resumes...I think they belong in the era of fax machines (who even owns this ancient machinery anymore?) A black generic typeface on a white piece of paper doesn't give you access to my personality...only a mere glimpse.
              I am more than a collection of company names, titles and dates.</li>

              <H2 class="text-center font-weight-bold" />I am more than a single title.</H2>Currently, my work involves helping others with the look, feel and function of their online presence. I also coach skydivers, and work in open heart surgery part-time. I have had many titles in many fields
              of work, but none of them completely define me. I can tell you that I have been a Drafter, a Graphic Designer, a Registered Nurse, a Skydive Coach and many other incredibly fun (and some boring) job titles. I have owned companies, and sold
              companies.

              <H2 class="text-center text-light font-weight-bold">I love to learn.</H2>In the past fifteen years I have learned how to learn, the right way to teach and how to manage very complex situations. My nursing positions taught me what to value in life, and what I was missing. I honed many valuable skills in customer
              service and leadership. It was these difficult situations that not only built my character, but helped me realize that I needed to be doing something that I loved on a daily basis. </li>

              <H2 class="text-center font-weight-bold">I love being creative.</H2>I have been doing freelance graphic design and wordpress web development intermittently for about five years, and have recently decided to transition to a Full-Stack Web Developer position. There are days where I lose track of time, and
              forget to eat while doing web development. I haven't experienced that level of passion in many things up until now. For me, Web development is more than pretty pictures and button clicks...let me help you turn your ideas into something real
              that represents you. When you choose to work with me, you get more than just templated e-mails, and scripted phone calls. I am here to be your partner in design and development.</li>
