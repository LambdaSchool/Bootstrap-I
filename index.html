          <p>Bender, a high-tech industrial metalworking robot, was built in 2996 at F√°brica Rob√≥tica De La Madre (Spanish: "Mom's Robot Factory"), a manufacturing facility of Mom's Friendly Robot Company in Tijuana, Mexico.</p>
          <p>However, the story of his construction remains a mystery. Although different creation processes have been shown, Cohen has stated that the viewer has only been shown Bender emerging from the machine that created him, while what happened inside the machine has not yet been revealed.</p>
