              <h5>A Full Stack Developer: Under Construction</h5>
              <p>I'm enrolled at Lambda School's Computer Science Program with a Web Development Emphasis. The languages I'm learning
                include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, SQL, MongoDB, Python/Django, and C. If this site didn't tip you
                off, we definitely learn our way aroung Bootstrap 4. Plus I'm learning a bit of Racket on the side to pay my
                respects. The experience is intense, and I will be well prepared to apply my skills to build web applications
                quickly, and just as importantly, right the first time.
              </p>
              <p>
                All that said, I've been around the block a few times:
