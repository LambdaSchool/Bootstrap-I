                    <p>Vendrick: the once great king of Drangleic, built his great kingdom on the ruins of the other kingdoms that preceded his, and on the souls of the Great Ones.
                       With the help of his brother, Lord Aldia,
                       Drangleic prospered.
                       The king favoured strength of arms, and soldiers who would stake their every battle on strength alone.
                       Sorcery appears to have been tolerated, but the king held a low opinion of miracles.</p>

                    <p>The Giant Lord: is the king of all Giants. After his kingdom was invaded by King Vendrick, whom was under the influence of Nashandra,
                      the Giant Lord invaded Drangleic to avenge his losses, and to retrieve the prize that Vendrick stole from him.
                       Possessing a will of iron, the giants laid siege to Drangleic in a war that lasted for generations, and laid waste to the once proud kingdom.</p>

                    <p>The Demon of Song: origins are unknown but it was originally sealed inside the Shrine of Amana due to it developing a taste for human flesh.
                      However, after the priestesses tasked with maintaining the seal died or became hollow, the demon was able to escape its prison.
                       Its name comes from its ability to mimic the song of the shrine maidens, in order to lure prey into its lair. </p>
