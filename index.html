                <p class ="lead"> I am Jonathan Jamel Holloway. I was born in Chicago IL on July 22, 1985.
                   I am professional in my conduct on the job with colleagues and customers.
                    I am patient and have an amicable personality. I have on the job experience as well as outside training.
                     My friendly personality makes me the ideal candidate for your company. I do a lot of studying on my own. 
                     I believe my self-starting attitude will allow me to be proactive and not reactive on the job.
                      I performed jobs that are physical in nature as well as jobs that challenge the mind.
                       My computer programming studies allow me to follow instructions with high accuracy as well as
                        understand the problems that can occur if one does not follow instructions. 
                        I am looking for a career that I can advance with and be financially secure.  </p>
