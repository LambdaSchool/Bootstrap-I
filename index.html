              <h2>Jobs previously held</h2>
              <p>Have worked my different types of jobs. First Job I ever worked was at Compusa.
                I dropped out of college and went to work for Dell, not the best move.
                Later on I worked at Verizon as a relay operator. Also I worked at a Toyota Dealership as a 
                car salesman. Then from 2010 - 2015 I worked at a computer lab at South Texas College in McAllen, Tx.
              </p>
              <h2>Where do I see myself in 10 years</h2>
              <p>In ten years I see myself being successful both materially and in other aspects that are more important.
                Also married and starting a family. Perhapse start a web based company with my brother who is also doing 
                a boot camp but with a different school. I look forward to working on projects with him but I also have 
                my own projects that I would like to bring to fruition as a software developer.
